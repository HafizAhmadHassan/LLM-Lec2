- We Also Have Notes
- LangChain is chain tool to build LLM

What Cover?
Goal?
What is LLM?
- LLM is Neural network designed to understand and learn Huaman Questions and create responses
[neural network representation]
Demonstration : Chatgpt
Respond Human Like Text

- Large Mean?
Models sizes were not big before 
It takes Billion of Params but now Trillion
[Graph GPT version params]
 decodes and Token size we will see later
[Nature publish Graph Parameters]

- Language Model means:
these models only deal with language They do NLP tasks:
    - Q&A
    - Translation
    - Sentimental Analysis
- LLM vs NLP?
NLP were much before LLM but designed for specific task
LLM can do wide range of tasks. aka. multiple tasks
Earlier langauge models could not write email for example for chatgpt it is very simple

- What is Secret Sauce of LLM?
Transformer architecture for example application to convert something image to  text we will learn more in details

"Attention Is ALL" you need is Architecture
Paper we will see this paper

- LLM vs Gen AI vs DL vs ML
LLM comes under GenAI comes under DL comes under ML comes under AI

for example ML has Decision Tree as well as Neural netrwork whereas Deep Learning only have Neural Network

check ploclub.gitbub.io/cnn-explainer
Digit Classifier example vizuara.ai

DL involve images
LLM only involves Language models
DL + LLM --> Generative AI : involves Language as well + image

Luftansa Flight chat assistant is rule based because we have choices
LLM leverage applications using DL techniques to create human like Text

Application?
    - Content Creation
    - Customer Care chatbots
    - Machine Translation
    - Novel Text Generation
    - Sentimental analysis : give bunch of paragraph and ask question 
    - There are several mpre
